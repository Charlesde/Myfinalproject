Summary - in no more than 4 sentences, briefly introduce your data visualization and add any context that can help readers understand it

These datasets are based on electronic records of the entire bwin.party betting history of 2,068 subscribers who triggered a responsible gambling intervention between November 2008 and November 2009 (i.e. RG cases) and 2,066 individuals who made an initial bwin.party deposit on the same day as an RG case, but did not trigger a responsible gambling intervention between November 2008 and November 2009 (i.e. controls). With this scatterplot, I want to visually show that there seems to be a relation between the total stakes and the time spend on fixed odds gambling. Also, it shows that gamblers that trigger a responsible gambling intervention have more extreme scores. 

Design - explain any design choices you made including changes to the visualization after collecting feedback



Feedback - include all feedback you received from others on your visualization from the first sketch to the final visualization
Resources - list any sources you consulted to create your visualization
